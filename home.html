        <p>UNSOLVED FACTS IN UNIVERSE</p>
        <P><b>1. Dark Matter-The spider's web</b></P>

        <p>Planets,stars,asteroids,galaxies-the things that we can actually see-make up less than 5% of the total
            universe.Scientists think another ~25% is a strange substance called dark matter: we can't see it ,we don't
            understand it,but we're pretty sure it's out there because everything moves to its gravitational tune.
        </p>
        <p>Scientists believe that dark matter acts like a spider's web,holding fast-moving galaxies together. And
            there's so much of this stuff that it bends the appearenceof space, so that when astronomers observe distant
            galaxies, they often appear distorted.
        </p>
        <p>We have plenty of evidencethat dark matter exists,but as for what it is, that remains a mystrey.Some think
            adark matter is composed of an undiscovered particle or particles,others believe it's an undiscovered
            property of gravity. Whatever the truth,dark matter is a real puzzle, and it's proved hugely tricky to pin
            down.</p>

        <p><b>2. Black holes -Massive Monsters</b></p>

        <p>A constant staple of sci-fi thrillers,black holes are violent,vastly destructive and invisible.</p>

        <p>Black holes are regions of space in which the force of gravity is so powerful that everything around is drawn
            in.Not even light can escape,which is why can't see any of this going on.</p>
        <p>Experts think there could be up to 100 million black holes in our galaxy alone, and these monsters can grow
            to become billions of times more massive than the sun. what's more,at the center of most galaxies,including
            our own,lurks a super-massive black hole.</p>
        <p>But we don't know what happens when objects pass through the center. They might become
            'spaghettified':stretched apart into long strings of matter; they could even be transported through a
            short-cut to a diffrent part of our universe.spooky.</p>

        <p>Image of the Crab Nebula, combining data from several telescopes. The Crab Nebula, the result of a bright
            supernova explosion seen by Chinese and other astronomers in the year 1054, is 6,500 light-years from Earth.

        <p><b>5.Kepler - 186f</b></p>
        <p>Kepler-186f, the first rocky exoplanet to be found within the habitable zone—the region around the host star
            where the temperature is right for liquid water. This planet is also very close in size to Earth. Even
            though we may not find out what's going on at the surface of this planet anytime soon, it's a strong
            reminder of why new technologies are being developed that will enable scientists to get a closer look at
            distant worlds.</p>
